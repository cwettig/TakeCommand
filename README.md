# TakeCommand

*Configurations for JP Soft's TakeCommand Windows command line replacement*

## TakeCommand

TakeCommand is a replacement for `cmd.exe` and in some cases even for `pwsh.exe`.
The software has been developed by [JP Software](https://jpsoft.com), a privately held corporation based in Chestertown, Maryland, USA. 
Their very first product (named *4DOS*) was developed in 1989 as a replacement for MS-DOS's `command.com`.

TakeCommand is closed and *"Windows-only"* software but I have been using their products since the early 1990's.
